#!/bin/sh
# check-control-bytes.sh - is there a literal control byte in any text file?
#
# The defect this exists to catch is a file that is invisible to review. A
# literal control byte makes a file unreadable to BOTH review tools at once:
#
#   - `grep` calls it binary and SKIPS it, saying so in a line nobody reads,
#     and "what else calls this?" is how most real holes get found;
#   - `git diff` prints "Binary files differ", so a code review of the file
#     shows NO DIFF AT ALL. `git diff --text` renders it fine, which is the
#     proof that only reviewability was ever at stake.
#
# ⭐ The runtime value is identical either way. Write the escape, not the byte:
# `\0` is the same character and stays reviewable. Because correctness never
# depends on it, this survives for a long time unnoticed.
#
# ⚠ IT IS NOT A RULE PEOPLE CAN REMEMBER. In the project this came from, the
# rule was stated in a shared source file and four source files broke it anyway,
# and the post-mortem writing up the lesson reintroduced the byte TWICE while
# writing about it. A rule that a careful person breaks while documenting it is
# a rule that needs a check.
#
# -- THE THREE BLIND SPOTS THIS SCOPE WAS PAID FOR ---------------------------
#
# 1. ⛔ TRACKED ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH. `git ls-files` cannot see a file that has
#    never been staged, which is exactly when a new file is most likely to
#    acquire a stray byte. A brand-new test file was written with a literal NUL
#    where a trailing space belonged; grep called it binary, an assertion went
#    green for the wrong reason, and the guard reported clean because the file
#    was not tracked yet.
#
# 2. ⛔ `git ls-files` IS RELATIVE TO THE PROCESS WORKING DIRECTORY, so this
#    guard's scope used to depend on who called it. Run from the repository
#    root it saw 1071 files; run from one package directory, which is where a
#    per-package test script invoked it, it saw 391 and nothing else. Whole
#    trees were outside the scope of the one invocation that ran on every gate,
#    and a literal NUL rode through two handoffs that each reported green.
#    ⭐ A guard cannot prove itself. It is pinned to the repository root here.
#
# 3. ⚠ BINARIES ARE OUT OF SCOPE BY CONSTRUCTION, not by an allowlist. The
#    extension list below says what IS text. An "allowlist of binaries that are
#    fine" is the kind of list that quietly absorbs a real finding.
#
# ⚠ MARKDOWN IS IN SCOPE HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE. check-docs.sh used to carry a
# markdown-only copy of this rule. Two checks enforcing one rule is two places
# for it to be wrong, so the rule lives here and check-docs.sh points at it.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/common/check-control-bytes.sh
#   sh scripts/common/check-control-bytes.sh --json
#
# Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 a byte was found, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.

# ⛔ THE FILE LIST GOES THROUGH A FILE, LINE BY LINE, NEVER THROUGH WORD

# skipped, and the check reported success over a file it had never opened.
# ⭐ Found with a fixture, not by reasoning: a file named with a space carrying
# a NUL was reported by the PowerShell twin and not by this one.

# ⭐ ONE awk PASS OVER EVERY FILE, NOT FIVE PROCESSES PER FILE. The loop this
# replaced ran grep, head, cut, wc and tr per file: about five spawns each, and
# a spawn under Git Bash costs more than reading the file does.
#
# Measured on one Windows 11 machine (10.0.26200) under Git Bash 5.3.15 on
# 2026-09-10, the two versions run back to back: 13.4s over 106 text files
# before, 0.6s over 111 after. ⚠ The second tree is the LARGER one, so the
# comparison understates the change rather than flattering it.
#
# ⚠ NUL IS WHY THIS IS NOT SIMPLY grep. A NUL cannot live in a shell variable,
# so it cannot be put in a pattern, and measured here on GNU grep 3.0 a file
# holding one is neither matched nor reported as binary: it is passed over in
# silence. awk finds it, because `sprintf("%c", 0)` builds the byte inside awk
# where no shell touches it.
#
# ⛔ AND awk IS NOT ASSUMED TO BE ABLE TO. Some awk implementations hold a
# record as a C string and truncate it at the first NUL, which would make this
# check report clean over a file full of them. That is the defect class this
# repository exists to refuse, so the ability is PROVED against a fixture on
# every run, and a `no` selects a byte-at-a-time reader rather than a wrong
# answer. The fixture crosses a pipe, never a variable.
