# check-attribution.sh - does any commit in this repository credit a tool?
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT: a commit message that names the tool that wrote it.
# docs/conventions/git.md states the rule, states that it overrides whatever a
# session's own default asks for, and says in as many words that a tool
# enforcing it mechanically beats a rule anyone has to remember. Nothing
# enforced it.
#
# ⚠ IT IS A RULE THAT GETS BROKEN BY DEFAULT, not by carelessness. Several
# agent tools instruct the model to append a co-author trailer, so the failure
# arrives from a setting rather than from a decision, and it arrives on every
# commit of a session rather than on one. Upstream, one session added a trailer
# to all eighteen of its commits before anything disagreed, and a second added
# one more months later. Both were found after the push.
#
# ⛔ THIS CHECK CANNOT PREVENT THE THING IT NAMES, AND THE HOOK IS WHY.
# It reads `git log`, which makes it the only check here whose subject is the
# history rather than the tracked tree. Every session's procedure is "run the
# gate, then commit", so at the moment this runs the commit being made does not
# exist yet. It reports afterwards. ⭐ `--message FILE` applies the same rules
# to a message that is not a commit yet, which is what dotfiles/githooks/
# commit-msg calls, and that is the half that refuses rather than records.
#
# ⚠ THE EMOJI RULE UPSTREAM CARRIES IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. Azathothas/
# ToolKit refuses any emoji in a commit message, on the evidence that its whole
# history is ASCII to the byte. That evidence does not exist here: measured on
# 2026-09-10, one commit in this repository's six carries a ⛔, quoting a rule.
# Porting the rule would fail this tree on its own history, and a rule with no
# incident behind it in the repository that holds it is a preference.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/common/check-attribution.sh
#   sh scripts/common/check-attribution.sh --json
#   sh scripts/common/check-attribution.sh --message .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
#
# Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 something credits a tool, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
