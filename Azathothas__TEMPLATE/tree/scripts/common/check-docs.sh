#!/bin/sh
# check-docs.sh - do the documents still resolve, and are they written the way
# this repository writes documents?
#
# The defect this exists to catch is a document that was true when it was
# written. Four shapes of it, and every one is invisible to every other check:
#
#   - a link or a path that stopped resolving when something was renamed;
#   - a fenced shell block that does not parse, which is a block nobody can
#     copy and paste;
#   - an angle-bracket placeholder inside a shell block: a human reads it as
#     "fill this in" and bash reads it as a redirect, so the reader gets a
#     cryptic syntax error instead of an obvious instruction;
#   - a PowerShell invocation in a block without -NoProfile, which runs the
#     profile scripts of whoever owns the machine before the command, and one
#     that prints a line puts that line in front of the output.
#
# ⚠ CONTROL BYTES ARE NOT CHECKED HERE. That rule scanned markdown only while
# every .ts, .py, .rs and .sh in the tree went unchecked, so it moved to
# check-control-bytes.sh, which reads every text file. Run both.
#
# ⚠ THE CHARACTER HALF OF THE PROSE RULE IS NOT HERE. No em dash and no
# character outside the five belong to check-markers.sh, which reads every
# tracked text file rather than markdown alone. Run both. What stays here is
# what is specific to a document: links, fenced blocks, placeholders and
# orphan pages.
#
# ⛔ WRITING STYLE IS NOT CHECKED HERE AND MUST NOT BE. This header claimed a
# banned-vocabulary rule for as long as no version of either half implemented
# one, and arming it settled the question rather than closing it: a word list
# catches `blazing`, which nobody here writes, and cannot catch `load-bearing`,
# which this tree writes twelve times. ⭐ The register that actually goes wrong
# in an agent's prose is metaphor used as jargon, and no list can hold it.
# docs/conventions/prose.md names the standard and the review pass reads for
# it.
#
# ⛔ WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK IS WHETHER A CLAIM IS TRUE. That is a reading, and
# it belongs to the review pass. A guard that tried to verify prose would
# either pass vacuously or refuse legitimate writing, and both are worse than
# an honest scope.
#
# ⚠ EVERY PER-LINE TEST IS DONE IN awk, NOT IN A SHELL LOOP. The first version
# ran a pipeline per line of every file, which is tens of thousands of process
# spawns, and it did not finish in two minutes on Windows. ⭐ It then ran two
# awk passes, a dirname and a subshell PER FILE, plus a tr and a grep PER
# BLOCK: about a thousand spawns over this tree, and a spawn under Git Bash
# costs more than reading the file does. It is now one awk pass over every
# file.
#
# Measured on one Windows 11 machine (10.0.26200) under Git Bash 5.3.15 on
# 2026-09-10, the two versions run back to back: 25.8s over 62 documents
# before, 4.9s over 65 after. ⚠ The second tree is the LARGER one, so the
# comparison understates the change rather than flattering it. The `sh -n`
# calls, one per fenced block, are most of what is left.
#
# ⛔ THOSE `sh -n` CALLS ARE NOT BATCHED, and the saving was declined on
# purpose. Concatenating every block of a file into one parse would let an
# unterminated quote in one block be closed by the next, so a broken block
# would report clean. A false pass is not worth the seconds.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/common/check-docs.sh
#   sh scripts/common/check-docs.sh --json
#   sh scripts/common/check-docs.sh --path docs
#
# Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 something is wrong, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
