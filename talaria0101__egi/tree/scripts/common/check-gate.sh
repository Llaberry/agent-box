# check-gate.sh - run every check in this directory, in one command, and read
# every exit code from the process that produced it.
#
# The defect this exists to catch is a gate that is a LIST. Part (a) of
# docs/methodology/gate.md names several checks, and a list run by hand is run
# in the order somebody recalls it. ⛔ The session that first wrote this ran its
# gate five times and typed a different subset each time. Nothing failed; the
# gate simply was not the same gate twice.
#
# ⭐ IT DELEGATES. It holds no rules of its own and it is not a second opinion
# about anything. Every verdict here is some other script's, read unpiped.
#
# -- ⛔ A SKIPPED CHECK IS A SKIP, NEVER A PASS -----------------------------
#
# `pwsh`, `jq`, `gh` and `shellcheck` are not on every machine. A runner that
# quietly dropped one and printed green would be the row in
# docs/conventions/forbidden-patterns.md that reads *a step that exits 0 having
# done nothing it was asked to do*.
#
# So a skip is counted, named, and printed on its own line. ⚠ The exit code is
# still 0, because a machine that cannot run a check has not failed it; ⭐ pass
# --strict to make a skip a failure, which is what a CI job should do, since
# there the tools are installed on purpose and a skip means the install broke.
#
# -- ⛔ THIS PROJECT CARRIES NO TWIN RUNNER ---------------------------------
#
# The template compares a POSIX half against a PowerShell twin. This project
# ships one implementation per check: the Windows daemon runs inside WSL2,
# where a POSIX shell is present. There is nothing to compare and no pair
# list to recurse into.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/common/check-gate.sh
#   sh scripts/common/check-gate.sh --strict   # a skip is a failure
#   sh scripts/common/check-gate.sh --json
#
# Exit codes: 0 nothing failed, 1 something failed, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
